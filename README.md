# Senviro Web Standard Integration

## Description
The files in this repository are contributions to the Master Thesis *Interoperability Enhancement of IoT Devices Using Open Standards in a Smart Farming Use Case*, composed by Daniel Marsh-Hunn. The repository contains resources, scripts and code for the deployment and integration of three different Web Standard implementations into [*SEnviro for Agriculture*](http://www.senviro.uji.es/), a full stack IoT for monitoring vineyards. The Master Thesis aims to investigate and compare different Web Standards to determine their aptitude for Smart Farming projects such as *Senviro for Agriculture*.

* OGC - Sensor Observation Service (SOS)
* OGC - SensorThings API
* Mozilla IoT - WebThing API
